# netflix-moblie-navigation
Netflix mobile navigation is a nav-based web project. It displays the actual navigation system of Netflix. It is simple, clean, and mobile responsive.


We are making a Netflix mobile navigation in this project. You can see how the navigation menu works on Netflix. When you click on the hamburger button you will see the animated navigation that floats from left to right. You can see two colour black and red showing the floating effect.

The project is simple and easy to use.The project has some text and a Netflix logo. It is a small and beginner project that you may require to enhance your skill. This is a front-end project, so the menu item does not take you to anywhere. Have a look at the screenshot below.
